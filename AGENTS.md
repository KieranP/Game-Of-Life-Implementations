# Multi-language implementations of Conway's Game of Life

This project contains nearly identical implementations of Conway's Game of Life in multiple programming languages to showcase core language constructs for comparison purposes.

When creating a new implementation or making changes to an existing implementation:

1. Stick as closely as possible to the structure and naming conventions used in the other implementations for consistency.
2. Unless a language requires otherwise to compile/run:
   - Indentation uses two spaces
   - Variable and function names should be snake_case
   - Class names should be PascalCase
   - Constants should be SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

When asked for suggestions for improving an implementation's performance:

1. World cells must remain as a HashMap with string keys. Do not suggest otherwise!
2. Only suggest things that can be applied to other implementations (i.e. nothing language-specific).
